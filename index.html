				<p class="paragraph">The Black Pearl (formerly known as the Wicked Wench) is a fictional ship in the
					Pirates of the Caribbean film series. In the screenplay, the ship is easily recognized by her
					distinctive black hull and sails. Captained by Captain Jack Sparrow, the Black Pearl is said to be
					"nigh uncatchable".</p>

				<p class="paragraph p-2">The curse could only be lifted when all eight hundred and eighty-two coins were
					returned to the chest along with a trace of blood from each pirate who stole one. William "Bootstrap
					Bill" Turner Sr., the only crew member who defended Jack Sparrow during the mutiny, sent a coin to
					his young son Will Turner in England, believing the crew "deserved to be cursed, and remain cursed".

			<h2 class="text-3">Dead Man's Chest</h2>
			<p class="paragraph p-3">One year later, the Black Pearl is still being captained by Jack Sparrow, although his crew is not
				content with him; it's been months since they did "a speck of honest pirating", and they are upset about
				the Royal Navy's pursuit and the hurricane. Davy Jones sends Bootstrap Bill Turner to remind Jack that
				he still owes his soul and one hundred years of service aboard the Flying Dutchman to Jones; Jack's
				thirteen years of captaincy have now passed. Jack is marked with the black spot, which means that the
				Kraken is now hunting to drag both Sparrow and his ship down to the Locker. </p>

		<p>One of my most treasured photos of my son and I was taken on a video camera and it’s even a little blurry. It
			was
			a selfie of us before selfies were a thing. We were laughing and giggling. It’s one of the best memories I
			have
			captured and I wouldn’t trade it.</p>
