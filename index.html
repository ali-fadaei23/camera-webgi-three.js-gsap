					Pirates of the Caribbean film series. In the screenplay, the ship is easily recognized by her
					distinctive black hull and sails. Captained by Captain Jack Sparrow, the Black Pearl is said to be
					"nigh uncatchable".</p>

				<p class="paragraph p-2">The curse could only be lifted when all eight hundred and eighty-two coins were
					returned to the chest along with a trace of blood from each pirate who stole one. William "Bootstrap
					Bill" Turner Sr., the only crew member who defended Jack Sparrow during the mutiny, sent a coin to
					his young son Will Turner in England, believing the crew "deserved to be cursed, and remain cursed".

			<h2 class="text-3">Dead Man's Chest</h2>
			<p class="paragraph p-3">One year later, the Black Pearl is still being captained by Jack Sparrow, although
				his crew is not
				content with him; it's been months since they did "a speck of honest pirating", and they are upset about
				the Royal Navy's pursuit and the hurricane. Davy Jones sends Bootstrap Bill Turner to remind Jack that
				he still owes his soul and one hundred years of service aboard the Flying Dutchman to Jones; Jack's
				thirteen years of captaincy have now passed. Jack is marked with the black spot, which means that the
				Kraken is now hunting to drag both Sparrow and his ship down to the Locker. </p>

			<h2 class="text-last">On Stranger Tides</h2>
			<p class="paragraph p-last">During the quest for the Fountain of Youth, Jack Sparrow met Hector Barbossa,
				now a privateer serving King George II's expedition for the Fountain, who insisted that his beloved
				Pearl was sunk, though Jack told Barbossa he should've been sunk with it. However, after being
				shanghaied aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack was shown the current state of the Black Pearl by
				Blackbeard's daughter, Angelica, who revealed Blackbeard kept each ship in a bottle as a prize. Angelica
				also told that Blackbeard was after the Fountain of Youth to save himself from getting killed by a
				"one-leg man" "At fortnight, Blackbeard will meet his death...". While Jack learned about the ships in
				bottles, Barbossa still believed the Pearl to be sunk as his true agenda for revenge against Blackbeard
				was revealed.</p>
